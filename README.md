This application use NextJs to serve both back-end and front-end resources.
Because of there are no user-specied data, all pages are pre-rendered by the server, and was cached for an hour (this also help reduce number of requests need to call 3rd party APIs, that will cost time and money).

We use ReactJs and some resources from MaterialUI + StyledComponents for build the responsive user interface.
